#### Hi, I am Dylan Weeks, a game programmer from Dallas, Texas with an interest in gameplay and physics programming. I am currently working towards a Masters of Interactive Technology in Digital Game Development at SMU Guildhall with a specialization in Software Development. I enjoy collaborating with designers and artists on a daily basis to apply my skills to solve technical problems and bring new and innovative game features to life!
