| A-BFS-DFS-Dijkstra:                                                           |  This is a program that analyzes the performance for the search algorithms of A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra.       |
| Travelling-salesman-problem-Brute-Force-vs-Dynamic-Programming                |  This program solves the traveling salesman problem using brute force and dynamic programming. There is a report is attached comparing and contrasting these two algortihms.        |
| Traveling-salesman-problem-Genetic-Algorithm-vs-Tabu                          |  Solves the traveling salesman problem using the genetic algorithm and tabu methods. A report is attached comparing and contrasting these two algortihms.     |
| Smurf-Programming-Language                                                    | This project is a custom programming language that is capable of supporting functions, closures, recursion, bound variables, conditional logic, and integer arithmetic. This custom language was created using Python.       |
