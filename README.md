# Projects:
## A-BFS-DFS-Dijkstra:
### This is a program that analyzes the performance for the search algorithms of A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra.

## Travelling-salesman-problem-Brute-Force-vs-Dynamic-Programming
### This program solves the traveling salesman problem using brute force and dynamic programming. Also a report is attached comparing and contrasting these two algortihms.

## Traveling-salesman-problem-Genetic-Algorithm-vs-Tabu
### Solves the traveling salesman problem using the genetic algorithm and tabu methods. Also a report is attached comparing and contrasting these two algortihms.
